IADB-ME-L1007	IS-POV	16010	The operation is the second phase of a multi-phase operation, ME-0244. Triggers to the second phase include evaluating impacts on urban beneficiaries.
IADB-ME0255	IS	15110	"Main objective will be to support SEDESOL in the execution of its ""Habitat""program, paying special attention to: (i) urban poverty improvement; (ii) women heads of households; and (iii) slum upgrading. The program will also include a component for the evaluation of all the social programs under SEDESOL's responsibility."
IADB-ME0259	RM-FIN	15111	In the last three years the authorities have performed a series of financial reforms in the banking sector, the stock market and the promotion of the saving and the popular credit. The objective of these reforms has been the fortification of the market mechanisms and the deepening and extension of the financial markets. The present operation of US$600 million, with two equal sections of US$300 million each one, will support the implantation of directed measures to continue and to deepen the process of policies reforms in three areas: 1) the banking system: The Mexican banking system has been solidifying its capital base and resuming the credit granting. In spite of the important advances, still an important increase of the credit to the PYMEs and certain reforms to the frame of supervision of the regulated financial organizations are needed. The measures considered in the project will include the strengthening of the mechanisms of early alert, sanctions regime, as well as the intervention faculties and corrective action of the CNBV. In addition, measures will be implanted to reduce the transaction costs of the credit operations to the PYMEs. 2) The capital markets: The stock-exchange financing has been growing rapidly in Mexico, impelled by the increase of the financial saving. The resources canalized through the institutional investors (Administrators of Pensions Funds, Investment funds) have been growing, increasing near approximately 2% of the GIP in 1997 to near 10% of the GIP by the end of 2003. In order to adjust to the last developments of the market and to the best international practices, the authorities are considering to make a series of modifications to the regulatory frame of the capital market. Within the Program directed measures are contemplated to strengthen the protection of the minority stockholders, the schemes of corporative government and the obligations to reveal and publish information. Also, mechanisms will be explored to facilitate the access from the PYMEs to the capital markets. 3) Public debt market: Like in other countries, in Mexico the public debt markets have been a very important factor in the development of the market of debt in general. The deliberate strategy applied by the authorities has allowed to the diversification of instruments and the expansion of terms generating an efficiency curve that today reaches the twenty years with instruments of fixed rate. That effort has allowed the consequent development of the market of private debt. The operation will include measures to gather and to extend this experience, that will be directed to introduce improvements in the mechanisms from information to the market, the development of new instruments, the diversification of the base of investors and the institutional strengthening of the institutional mechanism of the public debt.
IADB-ME0250	ED-VOC	11430	The project aims to improve quality and efficiency of technical education in Mexico, by means of making technical education more pertinent with respect to the needs of the productive sector. The project will achieve the above by updating and generating additional competency-based technical norms under the private sector leadership, which will stand as reference to the ongoing transformation of the study plans within the schools
IADB-ME0240	TD-TAA	33181	The objective of the Program is to strengthen the competitiveness of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Mexico to enable them to participate in export markets. The lack of access to medium and long-term finance is among the barriers that limit the development of the export-oriented SME sector. In order to facilitate access to such finance, the Government of Mexico has requested support from the IDB for Bancomext, both to address its financial condition as well as its operations, with an eye to support Bancomext's efforts to execute its mission both efficiently and competitively, without introducing distortions into the financial markets.
XM-DAC-301-2-103957-001	00001	41010	The Institute of Advanced Studies Canada-Mexico (IASCM-IEAMC) is a partnership between the University of Western Ontario (UWO),Canada, and four Mexican universities: Universidad Autonoma de Zacatecas; Universidad San Luis Potosi; Instituto Tecnologico de Celaya; and Universidad Michoacana San Nicolas Hidalgo. The purpose of the Institute is to research issues of environmental protection that are of importance to both Canada and Mexico, such as alternative sources of energy and fuels, energy transportation and distribution, and energy-related health, sociocultural, legal and migration issues. This grant will support activities aimed at developing the institutional capacity of the IASCM, including a meeting of the IASCM steering committee, workshops with various stakeholders, preparation of a 10-year plan and four 10-day working visits to Canada and Mexico by IASCM directors. During the working visits, the directors will meet with potential partners from universities, governmental and non-governmental agencies, and industry.

XM-DAC-301-2-104231-001	00001	16010	Latin American countries are rapidly catching up to the industrialized countries of the North in terms of birthrate and lifespan. Depending on the choice of policy, the aging population could generate increased public debt or increased private investment. This grant will allow researchers to analyze social protection systems in Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico and Uruguay using a modified National Transfer Accounts methodology. Of the five countries, the three smaller ones (Chile, Costa Rica and Uruguay) have well-established high-coverage social security systems, and the two larger ones (Brazil and Mexico) have comprehensive but low-coverage systems. The project will expand current understanding of transfers, demographic trends, intergenerational equity and the sustainability of social protection through transfers. It is also expected to inform the design of social protection schemes in the countries under study.
IADB-ME-L1012	IS-EMP	16020	The Program specific objectives are: (i) to foster initiatives of co-responsibility in which the Migrants and the three Government levels execute shared investment projects in order to improve the socio-economic conditions of selected communities; (ii) promote co-investment initiatives channeled to high emigration communities and high poverty levels; and (iii) to impulse identity links of the Migrants towards their communities of origin.
XM-DAC-301-2-104842-001	00003	11240	A substantial body of scientific evidence is emerging to suggest that many social and developmental disorders can be prevented by appropriate intervention at the earliest stages of childhood development. These studies indicate that many developmental, psychological, behavioural, physical and cognitive problems experienced by children at school-entry could have been mitigated through appropriate programs, thereby overcoming the legacy of underachievement and emotional difficulty imposed on children from impoverished or disadvantaged backgrounds.The proposed research initiative is designed to address the following three questions. Can the reported low rates of developmental, psychological and behavioural disorders in Cuba be validated? Can it be rigorously demonstrated that these prevalence rates are due to early childhood development programs? Can the principles embodied in these programs be exported to a different cultural and political context?This grant will provide start-up funding for a longitudinal study and early childhood education reform initiative. It will do so by supporting the engagement of a program coordinator and contributing to the cost of a protocol design meeting in Havana in December, 2007, plus a review meeting one year later. The protocol - a cross-sectional/longitudinal analysis - will be used to assess the number of vulnerable 5 year-old children in Cuba, and in comparable locations in Mexico and Canada. Researchers will compare the development of emotional control in 2-year-olds and 5-year-olds in the three countries. The basic question that needs to be addressed is whether there is little variance in the neural profiles of the 2-year-olds but significant difference in the 5-year-olds.

XM-DAC-301-2-105046-001	00001	31110	As a result of the drastic drop in international prices, several traditional coffee-growing areas in Veracruz, Mexico, are experiencing an increased rate of migration to Mexico City and the United States. The migrants - predominantly young men - send back remittances that are used by the remaining family members to pay debts and, in some cases, buy additional land or cattle. Selective migration has resulted in changes in traditional agricultural practices and natural resource use, with women taking on tasks usually performed by men, such as farm management and investment. But, this has not necessarily given women more autonomy in decision-making. This project will study changes in the division of labour between domestic groups resulting from accelerated migration, and their effect on access to, control of and benefits from natural resources. The idea is to enable more effective use of remittances to improve natural resource management at the community level and enhance the livelihoods of the families that stay on the land.

XM-DAC-301-2-105400-003	00004	15110	Since the end of the debt crisis of the 1980s, Latin American governments have reduced deficits, lowered fiscal volatility, increased public expenditure and pioneered fiscal innovations. Latin American economies differ from industrial economies in the way public revenues are structured, how decentralized the fiscal system is, and the public services citizens receive for their taxes. Latin American fiscal performance is still a long way from closing the gap with industrialized economies, and important problems remain. For example, revenue generation relies on non-tax sources, which tend to be volatile. And, the tax structure is heavily based on regressive indirect taxes while public spending plays a limited role in redistribution.This project aims to help governments in Brazil, Chile, Guatemala, Mexico and Uruguay deliver better and fairer public goods and services by providing them with a tax benefit micro-simulation platform called LATINMOD. The platform will be capable of simulating most proposed reforms in personal taxes and social benefits, and the mechanics of redistribution policies and how they interact with one another. By using micro data from representative surveys, LATINMOD will be able to characterize the population in aggregate as well as by age, sex, economic status, family composition, region and income level to identify those who win and lose under a given reform. It is expected that this will contribute toward more equitable, efficient and transparent fiscal and social protection systems, and help consolidate democratic regimes in the region.

XM-DAC-301-2-106361-001	00005	15160	In Latin America, specifically, Brazil and Mexico, both public and private sectors are engaged in the capture, storage and management of personal data. These data are used for a wide range of purposes, such as, improving service delivery, and security and policing measures. However, data management and use is taking place in a context of poor or absent regulation and limited citizen engagement with policymakers. Inherent in the collection, management and use of personal data is a process of social classification that both includes and excludes.This project constitutes the first step in promoting public debate and influencing public policy on the issue of the protection of personal data in Latin America. It will lay the groundwork for a full-fledged research project targeting certain kinds of personal data collection and available policy windows in the region. The project will focus on three particular personal data-related activities: unique national ID cards; video-surveillance in public spaces; and the collection and control of personal data on the Internet.The work will be carried out by researchers in Brazil and Mexico who are part of a nascent research network on surveillance studies in Latin America. The network includes David Lyon, a professor and world renowned surveillance expert at Queen's University in Kingston (Canada). The group has been active for the past two years, holding symposiums on surveillance in Latin America. The researchers will map personal data collection policies and practices, and their possible connection with forms of inclusion and exclusion of citizens in public life. The project is expected to help consolidate the aforementioned network, and to generate a research proposal.

XM-DAC-301-2-106605-001	00005	33110	Rigid intellectual property norms and intensified enforcement have prompted media and medicine suppliers alike to price their products beyond the reach of all but the most affluent segment of the population. This is particularly the case in large middle income countries such as Brazil, India, Russia and South Africa. Recognition of the problem has led to a shift in international policy - evident in the Doha Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) - in favour of increased flexibility of patent policy with respect to pharmaceuticals in developing countries. But there has not been a similar shift in the international copyright discourse and policy agenda relating to media products. This project will begin filling the void with a set of activities promoting a positive agenda for global copyright policy for developing countries, including an online resource centre for scholars and advocates, a series of working papers translating new research into policy proposals, and two international meetings of researchers and advocates of public interest intellectual property rights. A major goal of the project is to promote recommendations for international and national copyright reform.

XM-DAC-301-2-106444-001	00005	11420	The developing regions of the world are often treated as a subject of interdisciplinary study in university in, for example, programs of African, Asian or Middle Eastern studies. Yet there is not a strong tradition for treating North America, including Central America and the Caribbean, as a region, even though the continent includes some of the richest and poorest countries in the world. This grant will allow St Antony's College at the University of Oxford to establish a 2-year post doctoral position on Central America and the Caribbean under the leadership of Canadian historian, Margaret MacMillan. The position will be awarded to a scholar from the region, in keeping with IDRC's philosophy that developing country researchers are best placed to identify and tackle development challenges.

The study will attempt to answer the following three questions. Who perpetuates violent crime and why? What are the dynamics that determine who is victimized and how victimization takes place (particularly with respect to women and youth)? And, what conditions the recruitment of young people and children into criminal networks? The new evidence is expected to expand the knowledge base and inform policy recommendations for enhanced public safety and more effective juvenile justice.

XM-DAC-301-2-106782-001	00005	16063	"Violent conflict related to drug trafficking in Mexico has had a profound impact on the quality of life and health of affected communities. Nevertheless, there is very little evidence about who these victims are, how they are victimized, and what the state's response to these victims has been or should be.In the past five years, violent conflict has risen significantly in many parts of Mexico, mostly due to illegal drug trafficking and  the government's response to it, widely known as the""war on drugs.""Although everyone agrees that an epidemic of violence exists and is claiming many direct and indirect victims, there is no reliable data on how many civilians have died in clashes between security forces and drug traffickers or in executions related to the drug trade. The extent of violence committed against women is also unknown, as is the number of people who have moved to escape the violence.Researchers will undertake a qualitative study of six municipalities in Mexico that are experiencing different levels of violence associated with the war on drugs. Its focus is on the experience of victims and the state's response to victimization. Of particular interest is the need to document the forms of victimization that women and children undergo.The evidence researchers gather will help produce a more accurate picture of the impact that the war on drugs is having on individuals and communities. The goal is to use this evidence to help create legal frameworks and institutional reforms that will allow Mexican institutions to respond adequately to the situation.Expected outcomes of the research include a handbook that outlines services and programs for victims of violent crimes in the study areas, a guide and training module that focuses on special services for women and children, training for young researchers to increase their capacity to influence public policy, and the launch of a website."
XM-DAC-301-2-106969-001	00005	12110	Inequities in accessing health care and related services in Mexico are markedly higher among indigenous peoples, especially women and other vulnerable groups.Access to health care is a basic right guaranteed by the Mexican constitution. However, the decentralization of responsibility for health from the federal to the state level has resulted in a misalignment between power and responsibility on the one hand, and transparency and accountability on the other. As a result, some areas of Mexico - notably the southern states with large indigenous populations - have experienced disproportionately higher health inequities. Maternal mortality rates, for example, are nearly three times higher than the national average in parts of the country with large indigenous populations.Addressing these inequities requires strategies for influencing public health policy and garnering political will. Reclaiming transparency and accountability at different levels of government will be central to this process. Civil society organizations (CSOs) can play an important role in helping indigenous women and other vulnerable groups articulate and demand better health services. However, those states with the highest inequities are also among those with the most under-developed civil society.This research project will examine the role Mexican CSOs play in influencing more equitable public health policies and processes to improve indigenous women's health. Working with researchers, advocacy groups, and different levels of government, it will generate evidence on the nature and extent of CSO involvement and interaction with other stakeholders. The project will develop a theoretical framework for examining CSO strategies, coalitions, tools, and advocacy practices and will support research that analyzes how they can better influence public health policy in Mexico. Workshops and seminars will encourage dialogue and debate, and communicate the findings widely.The project will generate original research and a shared theoretical framework that can be applied to further study. Peer-reviewed publications, policy briefs, and audio-visual products will communicate findings to different audiences. The research will also raise awareness of the benefits of civil society participation and produce sound evidence that can help build strategic coalitions and influence policy.
XM-DAC-301-2-106762-001	00004	15130	Outdated and inefficient labour laws and courts make it difficult for workers in Mexico to resolve labour disputes and secure compensation.Although Mexico has rebounded from its 2009 slump, the country's labour market has yet to return to its pre-recession state. Nationally, the official unemployment rate is 5%, only slightly lower than in 2009. Newly created jobs are not as good as those jobs lost during the downturn.Traditionally, labour regulations in Mexico are based on the Mexican Constitution of 1917 and Mexico's Federal Labour Law. All Mexican workers enjoy protection thanks to rules that govern working conditions, labour contracts, minimum wages, employee benefits, and union activity. If the rules are violated, workers have the right to file suit in the labour courts. However, labour courts, known as juntas, have become an obstacle in themselves.Of all workers who go to court and obtain compensation from the court (usually 20% less than what they requested), less than half end up receiving the compensation awarded by the courts. Even worse, the workers'legal costs tend to represent half of any compensation received.Research led by the Instituto Tecnológico de México focuses on the country's legal environment and aims to address the administrative procedures related to rulings and notifications that impede justice for Mexican workers. In a case study of a large court in Cuautitlan in the State of Mexico, researchers will examine two procedures that they believe will shed light on what policy options could work best: (1) improved processing of decisions to reduce clerical errors; and (2) improved notification processes.The research will examine the effects of two interventions: correcting clerical errors and providing on-the-job training to court clerks. Research results are also expected to inform the operations of other Mexican courts, as well as courts elsewhere in Latin America.

Teams of indigenous women have been formed in each of Argentina, Colombia and Mexico and each team has selected specific themes requiring investigation: education, health and the impact of armed conflict on indigenous women. The research will be grounded in women's experiences, and complemented by the use of sociological and legal instruments, as well as an adjudicative strategy that makes use of national legal systems and the Inter-American Human Rights system. The research is expected to contribute to social and legal reforms aimed at reducing the multiple forms of discrimination experienced by indigenous women, and promote the proper implementation of current legislation in the three countries involved and at the international level.

The change they are driving is not always positive, however. This presents new challenges for governing institutions as the lines between legitimate and illegitimate, civil and uncivil action become blurred. The reaction of many governments to cyber-enabled threats has been to securitize cyberspace by imposing censorship, surveillance, and other forms of control. However, restrictions to the openness of cyberspace endanger its capacities to enhance productivity, prosperity, communication, good government, and personal and communal empowerment.In Latin America cyberspace is often used by transnational criminal gangs and narco-traffickers, posing threats to the state. Here, two-thirds of Internet users are under 25, and of all Internet users, 84% are Facebook users. There are growing possibilities for fraud and cybercrime. Countries such as Brazil and Mexico are already hotbeds for cybercrime worldwide.Led by the SecDev Group, this research project will examine such issues in Latin America, where the contest between securitization and preservation of openness in cyberspace is driven by criminal activity. Researchers will combine a general panorama of organized crime and cyber-security with in-depth regional cases, producing an edited volume. Their findings are expected to make an important contribution to a number of regional legislative discussions about Internet regulation."

XM-DAC-301-2-106885-001	00001	12110	Mexico's growing rate of obesity has seen the government explore how front-of-package labels might encourage better food choices by its citizens.Mexico's disease profile has been transformed from one of hunger and infectious and parasitic diseases to one dominated by obesity, diabetes, and othernutrition-related non-communicable diseases.  The country's rapid shifts in dietary and physical activity patterns, along with higher rates of obesity, areamong the highest ever recorded.The government's response to this problem includes plans for a front-of-package (FOP) labelling system that will promote better food choices and improvenutrition literacy among citizens. At present, the country has no mandatory nutritional labelling or regulations on what the food industry can put on foodlabels.Many high-income countries have food-labelling systems, with varied levels of success. Major food companies often object to labelling systems that aresimple, promote healthy foods, are science-based, and that countries set up without direct input from the industry.And there are concerns that the Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) system, common to developed countries is complex and may in fact mislead consumers.This research project aims to describe and better understand the political, social, legal, and financial factors that support or constrain Mexico's proposedFOP nutrition labels plans. It involves an assessment of changes in consumers'behaviour, and of how they might understand, accept, and use FOP labellingbefore and after it comes into force.Given the challenges that may be part of any plan to adopt and implement FOP labels, the project will also assess the impacts that change might create amongstakeholder groups, such as politicians, consumers, advocates, and industry leaders. It will also measure the change in availability of food products withnew nutrition labelling.This research on a food labelling system in Mexico may be one of the first examples of such a project in a LMIC and could eventually apply to other LMICs.Researchers intend to publish their results and present reports on progress, barriers, and solutions at local and regional meetings in the second year ofimplementation. This will include a report on the political context, political process, and stakeholder reactions once the new labelling system is in force.

XM-DAC-301-2-107231-002	00005	43082	As it affirms its status as a middle- income region, Latin America and the Caribbean has experienced changes in research for development funding. Traditional donors have withdrawn their funding. With stronger economies, governments in the region have increased spending on science, technology, and innovation (STI). They have also enhanced their outgoing international scientific cooperation.Despite the signs pointing to increased regional cooperation in STI for development, there are large knowledge gaps about the details of this type of collaboration. These can only begin to be filled by answering the following questions:-Are efforts to support applied research for development the outcome of deliberate political decisions to support this type of research or the result of a bottom-up demand to dedicate STI resources, or a combination of both?- What proportion of new and existing STI funding is being dedicated to research for development in countries leading the push for more STI funding in the region?- How does each country define this type of applied research?- How do these countries partner with neighbouring countries, or countries facing similar socio-economic challenges, for research for development projects?- What specific research issues do these countries wish to pursue through collaboration with other countries in the Americas?- Is research on the determinants of equitable economic growth and sustainable development present in these work agendas? How?This project will establish four Joint Scientific Chairs for Research for Development in the Americas to support and manage cooperation in research for development in the Americas. This support will be offered in collaboration with local partners (national or state science granting councils or other public research funding agencies) in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico. Chairs will focus their research on hemispheric cooperation. They will also examine their country's role in supporting research for equitable and sustainable development at the national and regional levels. They will study and share evidence from successful Latin American cases. In doing so, the Chairs will improve domestic and international communication and coordination on the role of science and research in development. Ultimately, this will help stimulate this type of cooperation in the future.IDRC will contribute a maximum of $200,000 for each Chair to implement a research program which considers the characteristics of each country and its focus area of cooperation within the region. Chairs will be located in research institutions with sound track records of collaborating with the national scientific granting councils from each of the four countries. IDRC and a national scientific granting agency from each of the four countries will manage the selection process.

XM-DAC-301-2-107497-001	00005	15110	Open Government initiatives around the world promise to strengthen democracy and citizens'quality of life through a combination of technology, government transparency, and citizen participation. Mexico and Brazil are founding members of Latin America's Open Government Partnership (OGP), a new multilateral initiative that aims to get concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.Sixteen other Latin American countries have prepared and presented their initial action plans for greater openness in government to the OGP. However, to go beyond the rhetoric of openness, governments need to provide evidence that their priorities are based on the real needs of their citizens. In addition, they must make progress in the following areas:-creating reciprocal channels of communication between government departments and civil society;-implementing freedom of information acts; and,-developing and integrating open data strategies.Many Latin American governments are taking their first steps in this long process. It requires a new range of technological solutions and fundamental cultural shifts within governments. Despite the initial commitment to Latin America's Open Government agenda, early analysis reveals challenges in consolidating open government in the region. Among these, the most crucial include:-enormous diversity in how countries understand open government;-concerns about how complex government documents are for average citizens;-weak consultation processes;-lack of innovation in countries'open government activities;-vague commitments to open government; and,-lack of concrete targets.This project aims to meet these challenges and support progress in open government in Latin America. It builds on the successful experiences of the Latin American e-Government (RedGealc) network, an IDRC-supported project, which served as a channel for sharing e-government experiences in the region. The project will analyze the rapidly changing nature of open government in Latin America and bring together government representatives involved in a wide range of transformations to establish a road map for meeting open government commitments.The project team will also develop a diagnostic tool to build a common conceptual understanding of open government initiatives. Researchers will develop analytical tools to help assess whether government activities are meeting open government standards. They will also identify institutional obstacles to overcome in order to move toward greater openness.

Chairs will focus their research on hemispheric cooperation. They will also examine their country's role in supporting research for equitable and sustainable development at the national and regional levels. They will study and share evidence from successful Latin American cases. In doing so, the Chairs will improve domestic and international communication and coordination on the role of science and research in development. Ultimately, this will help stimulate this type of cooperation in the future.IDRC will contribute a maximum of $200,000 for each Chair to implement a research program which considers the characteristics of each country and its focus area of cooperation within the region.

XM-DAC-301-2-107474-002	00004	16020	Women's increased participation in Latin America's labour markets has been one of the most significant changes to those markets in the last 30 years. Still, their participation is well below men's, and the rate of increase is slowing down.Despite high economic growth, falling income inequality, poverty reduction, and improvements in women's education, women continue to be at a disadvantage for job opportunities and working conditions. These inequalities suggest that women face gender-based constraints. These may be based on rules, customs, beliefs, and values. They may also be the result of institutions that reproduce these inequalities. Among women, there are also strong differences. Uneducated and poor women participate less in paid work.Different policies have tried to tackle these gender disparities. Policies to foster employment have focused on promoting entrepreneurship through support for micro-enterprises. There remains a key gap, however. Policies designed to improve the quality of jobs for women who are already employed are scarce, and their impact is not clear. The region has expanded social protection programs, yet how these programs support women's economic empowerment and labour market participation is disputed. Some argue that social protection programs can reinforce traditional women's roles while others argue that they enhance women's autonomy and empowerment.This project seeks to explore these issues, and more specifically, the determinants of women's labour market participation. Researchers will examine the constraints that explain occupational segregation (i.e., fields of work occupied mostly or only by women), precarious work, and low-income levels. They will analyze the consequences on poverty, inequality, and growth. They will apply an innovative mix of research methods and analytical approaches to provide in-depth insight into the way gender-based constraints operate in different contexts, and what can be done to transform them. The project will help strengthen skills and knowledge in the area of gender, labour market, and social policy analysis and evaluation among policymakers, women's advocacy NGOs, and young researchers.The project involves eight country case studies, regional and comparative research, and a call for impact evaluation studies, training, and dissemination activities. The findings will serve to improve the effectiveness of current policies to promote gender equality in labour markets and to ensure better economic opportunities for women. The Centro Interdisciplinario de Estudios sobre el Desarrollo, Uruguay, will lead the project, in collaboration with the Center for Distributive, Labour and Social Studies at Universidad Nacional de La Plata.

XM-DAC-301-2-107607-001	00004	15113	Project AbstractThis project will propose concrete recommendations, based on applied research that will help Latin America's border regions tackle illicit drug activity. The project team will establish a network of researchers across Latin America who will document the political economy of illicit activity in eight Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru.The cost of Latin America's drug problemAcross the region, the scale of cross-border illicit drug activity is just beginning to be understood. Rough estimates from the United Nations indicate that the commercial value of the cross-border illegal drug trade in Latin America is US$450 billion annually.Add another US$12 billion for the illegal trafficking of small arms and yet another US$40 billion for the illegal tobacco trade. Then, there is the violence. Latin America's border towns are now home to some of the extreme levels of violence in the region.The problem with security strategiesA number of countries and international organizations have championed cross-border security strategies. These promise an integrated and cooperative approach to tackling illicit networks and cross-border trade. But the approaches are often mired by institutional weakness, eroded by competing interests or corruption, and thwarted by powerful illicit networks. The resources and level of influence these networks have at their disposal far outstrip those available to most border services and local governments.How a regional research network will helpThe research network will develop a broad understanding of the illegal markets operating in all eight countries, along with the techniques and strategies illicit networks use to exploit weaknesses in border controls as they expand their activities to new markets. The project objective is to investigate the geography, nature, scale, and impact of transnational organized crime.Researchers will map illegal markets by characterizing the location, nature, and scale of illegal activity (drug trafficking, small arms, chemical precursors, human trafficking, contraband smuggling, and money laundering). They will identify actors and institutions who can enhance the accountability and legitimacy of public and private authorities.The network will also assess the effectiveness of government strategies and policies to stop illicit activity across borders across the region. They will make evidence-based recommendations to policymakers, business leaders, and community-based actors in order to reduce illicit activity and the violence that comes with it. Ultimately, the goal is to transform these border regions into more secure and prosperous areas.

In September 2013, OMX shared  this  situation  with the  OI Board  and  EDs  Group,  and  agreed  with  the  Secretariat  a series  of actions  to accompany the organization in a processof clarifying and defining strategies for its future stability and growth.Between October 2013 and January 2014, the organization received several high-¬-level advisory visits from the Confederation,  and underwent  an intense  process  of reflection  withinthe operational  team and board.  From a starting point of the institutions financial challenge, this reflection allowed the team to revisit the organization in a holistic  way,  identifying  opportunities to build over the coming  years  a more  vibrant,  sustainable,  relevant  and influential Oxfam in Mexico.In February  2014, Oxfam  Mexico  shared  with the Confederation  a Stability  and Growth  Plan, the result of the process described  above.  This plan outlines  the principle  objectives  and strategies  tostrengthen  Oxfam  Mexico over the next three years, and specifies the financial support needed from the Confederation.  The plan is also a basis to orientate a dynamic of greater interaction  programmatic, conceptual and financial -¬-   between OMX and OI within the framework of the 2020 vision.After  five  years  as  Oxfam Mexico,  Oxfam Mexicohas  demonstrated   the  relevance  and  importance   of  having  a  national and autonomous  Oxfam  in Mexico.  The Oxfam  model  adds value to the work of civil society  inMexico;  and Oxfam Mexico supports  the  Confederations  vision  of  being  a more  global  and  representative  movement  in  the fight against poverty and injustice.PROGRESS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN STRATEGIC PROGRAMME AREASOMXs Stability and Growth Plan prioritizes four main institutional areas over the next three years:1.	Strengthening our programmatic and campaigns model.2.	Positioning and income generation.3.	Strengthening and institutional and administrative development.4.	Strengthening our institutional governance.This proposal responds to priorities 1 and 3 of OMXs plan  strengthening our programmatic and campaigns model; and strengthening our institutional and administrative development, -¬-   as well as to Oxfam Mexicos engagement with Oxfam 2020.Overall program: 1.2, OI 8Program 1: Sustainable livelihoods"

XM-DAC-301-2-107775-001	00002	12240	As urban populations grow in developing countries, promoting inclusive growth that ensures food security for all is critical. This project will offer new insights into the informal food sector, and identify entrepreneurship and job opportunities for women and youth.Growth in urban populationsThe urban population in developing countries is expected to exceed 50% for the first time by 2020. Over the next 30 years, these cities will absorb 95% of urban growth. By 2030, they will be home to almost 4 billion people, or 80% of the world's urban population.As people move to the cities, there is a growing crisis of food insecurity. Food prices are high and incomes are low. Even in countries experiencing rapid economic growth, food insecurity is a major challenge. Within this context, the urban food economy is an important laboratory for examining whether and how inclusive growth strategies can have a positive impact by encouraging entrepreneurship, raising incomes, alleviating poverty, and mitigating the crisis of food insecurity.The Hungry Cities InitiativeThe goal of the Hungry Cities Initiative is to promote inclusive growth in the informal food sector through research on policy approaches that enable it, combined with measures that support entrepreneurship and decent employment. The Hungry Cities Initiative seeks to provide a global perspective on the links between three major transformation processes: rapid urbanization, the crisis of food insecurity, and the informal economy's emergence as the major source of livelihood for urban poor, including women and youth.The African Centre for Cities at the University of Cape Town (South Africa) and the Balsillie School of International Affairs at Wilfrid Laurier University (Canada) run the Hungry Cities Initiative. They work with five other Canadian universities, together with researchers and municipal governments in seven cities in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean.How this research will make a differenceThe research team will analyze formal and informal urban food systems in the partner cities, how they interact, how they are governed, and their respective contribution to food security and inclusive growth.This project will:-provide evidence of entrepreneurial challenges and opportunities in the urban informal food system;-identify potential opportunities for women and youth to be incorporated as entrepreneurs and employees with decent jobs;-deliver knowledge through workshops, training, and consultations to inform policy and practice at the municipal level on enterprise development, entrepreneurship, and innovation in the informal food economy;-support 24 students (one post-doctoral, three PhD and 20 master's students) to develop research and collaborate with their Canadian peers; and-offer six policy workshops on urban food security and inclusive growth.The International Partnerships for Sustainable Societies program is funding this project. Team members from Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean are largely supported by IDRC. The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada provides support to the Canadian team.

Poor diet is increasingly contributing to preventable, premature deaths and illnesses related to NCDs. This project will monitor and benchmark food policies and environments in Mexico and Chile to address the problem. Specifically, it aims to enhance government and private sector accountability to increase healthy foods, and reduce obesity and diet-related NCDs.Demographic changes in Latin America, combined with shifting nutritional habits, have led to increases in obesity and diabetes rates. Globally, researchers have found that unhealthy food environments drive unhealthy diets. However, there is a lack of rigorous and comparable data from Latin American countries.Food environments are defined as the collective physical, economic, policy, and socio-cultural surroundings, opportunities, and conditions that influence people's food consumption patterns.The core premise of this project is that regular, comparable monitoring of food environments and the policies shaping them will allow evaluation of the impact of national food policies on obesity and NCDs, especially when surveyed across countries and over time.The project team will conduct the research in Chile and Mexico. Researchers will use the monitoring tools developed by the INFORMAS network (International Network for Food and Obesity/Non-Communicable Diseases Research, Monitoring and Action Support).

These pilots offer:-consumption support-savings mobilization-financial literacy-livelihoods training-asset transferTesting new approachesIn partnership with the Ford Foundation, researchers will build on earlier work to test innovations and generate evidence on how to take them to scale. The project will help move large numbers of the extreme poor (mostly women) into the market economy by preparing them for self-employment and teaching them to use formal financial services.The innovations to be tested include:-using information and communication technologies for training and coaching-introducing cash instead of in-kind transfers-working with the private sector to find market channels for micro-entrepreneurs'products and services-examining how cash transfer safety nets for youth, combined with training and coaching, can create sustainable pathways out of extreme povertyThe project team will work with governments in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Paraguay, and Mexico to form critical partnerships so that pilots can be taken to scale. The innovations developed through this project will help reduce costs, standardize, simplify, and facilitate implementation.The project will explore gender differences to determine program approaches that will allow vulnerable women to benefit equally. It will also help identify interventions to foster women's economic empowerment.

However, young people are still waiting to see the benefits of this growth. This project will support a workshop to discuss the drivers and motivations of marginalized youth, develop research tools, and establish a joint research agenda on the issue.Employment outlook for young peopleThere are almost 110 million youth in Latin America, and most of them face acute problems when seeking a job. Despite higher educational levels, the employment outlook for young people is not promising. Of every three young workers, two are employed in precarious jobs.More than 20 million youth (almost 1 in 5) are""Not in Education, Employment, or Training,""also known as NEET. In the lowest fifth, 30% of youth are NEETs. Of the NEETs aged 15 to 18 in 2009, two-thirds were women.Falling into the NEET position causes frustration among youth. This can lead to social instability and affect democratic governance. In recent years, idle youth have been implicated in rising crime rates for many countries in the region.Jobs, social cohesion, stability, and prosperityThe interdependence between youth employment and social cohesion, democratic stability, and prosperity is broadly accepted. Yet, there are questions in most policy circles about how young people's labour market experience affects their engagement with their communities, their commitment to societal norms and values, and the accumulation of social capital (networks that benefit them).What interventions can address these relationships? How important is a positive labour market environment for youth for overall social cohesion?Many stakeholders are looking for new policy approaches, yet there are few clear insights on what these new approaches should look like. In this context, it is essential to develop an in-depth understanding and knowledge of youth priorities, and to assess possible solutions to the problem from young people's perspective.Research to find solutionsIDRC is exploring a partnership with the UK's Newton Fund and the Economic and Social Research Council to promote cost-effective approaches to support disadvantaged youth in four countries: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico.The project team will survey youth who are directly affected by the NEET syndrome to understand the drivers that move youth into a NEET situation. It will also support a workshop in Santiago, Chile, in March 2015 with international researchers. Participants will refine the survey design to allow comparisons between the four participating countries.IDRC and Fundacio¿n Espacio Pu¿blico, a think tank in Chile, will organize the event. The workshop will also allow researchers from the four countries to discuss priorities for a research agenda. This will help inform future IDRC efforts to move ahead on this broader international partnership to address the employment, social, and other challenges facing youth."

How?This project will establish four Joint Scientific Chairs for Research for Development in the Americas to support and manage cooperation in research for development in the Americas. This support will be offered in collaboration with local partners (national or state science granting councils or other public research funding agencies) in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico. Chairs will focus their research on hemispheric cooperation. They will also examine their country's role in supporting research for equitable and sustainable development at the national and regional levels. They will study and share evidence from successful Latin American cases. In doing so, the Chairs will improve domestic and international communication and coordination on the role of science and research in development. Ultimately, this will help stimulate this type of cooperation in the future.IDRC will contribute a maximum of $200,000 for each Chair to implement a research program which considers the characteristics of each country and its focus area of cooperation within the region. Chairs will be located in research institutions with sound track records of collaborating with the national scientific granting councils from each of the four countries.

This plan outlines  the principle  objectives  and strategies  to strengthen  Oxfam  Mexico over the next three years, and is a follow up of the financial support that was given in 2014 and specifies the financial support needed from the Confederation. The plan is also a basis to orientate a dynamic of greater interaction  programmatic, conceptual and financial -­-   between OMX and OI within the framework of the 2020 vision.After  five  years  as  Oxfam,  Oxfam has demonstrated   the  relevance  and  importance   of  having  a  national  and autonomous Oxfam  in Mexico.  The Oxfam  model  adds value to the work of civil society  in Mexico;  and Oxfam Mexico  supports  the  Confederations  vision  of  being  a more  global  and  representative movement  in  the  fight against poverty and injustice.OMXs Stability and Growth Plan prioritizes four main institutional areas over the next three years:1.	Strengthening Oxfam Mexicos programmatic and campaigns model.2.	Positioning and income generation.3.	Strengthening andinstitutional and administrative development.4.	Strengthening Oxfam Mexicos institutional governance.This proposal responds to priorities 1 and 3 of OMXs plan  strengthening the programmatic and campaigns model; and strengthening the institutional and administrative development, -­-   as well as to Oxfam Mexicos engagement with Oxfam 2020.This proposal responds to OMXs second objective by aiming to contribute to reverse the situation mentioned in the section above. OMX tries to achieve this by training, guidingand supervising indigenous artisan womens social enterprises and eventually positioning them adequately in the market, so that more jobs and decent incomes may be generated in the long run. This project addresses gender-based inequalities that affect rural indigenous women in Mexico, who face a triple discrimination due to their gender, ethnic and cultural belonging, as well as their socio-economic vulnerability. It is expected that these new opportunities will enable artisan women to stabilize their family finances and to trigger an integral positive change in their communities and Mexican society, which will favor the production of healthy food, the respect towards their traditional expressions and, in general, the exercise of their economic, social, cultural and environmental rights. But more than that, this initiative forms part of a broader vision on shifting power relations between men and women throughthe assignment of value to a traditional activity of Mexican artisan women of indigenous origin.Overall objective: Strengthen the entrepreneurial skills of indigenous women who elaborate products for the artisan branch, aiming at their integration in fair trade markets."

Indigenous peoples have the poorest health in the region, due to such factors as geographic isolation, limited access to safe water, sanitation and food, and a poor understanding of, and sensitivity to, cultural beliefs and practices. Among the indicators of greatest concern is the high rate of maternal mortality. Indigenous women consistently experience higher maternal mortality rates than non-indigenous women in Latin America.Efforts to improve maternal health for indigenous women and adolescent girls must be based on a clear understanding of how to provide and measure high-quality care that ensures adequate health outcomes with dignity. This project examines quality of care from a cultural and a technical perspective in three indigenous communities in Mexico, Peru, and Argentina. Each of these three case studies will explore perceptions of quality care among indigenous women, and will involve collection and analysis of data using a customized framework for quality of care indicators.The study will examine the implementation of integrated health service delivery networks in all the three countries. These networks are designed to coordinate different health providers and services and each country is implementing them differently. The three case studies will examine how the networks positively or negatively influence quality of care processes and outcomes. Results from the individual case studies and from the project as a whole are expected to inform strategies for scaling up efforts to improve quality of maternal care for indigenous populations.Expected outputs include scientific publications in Spanish- and English-language journals, and information sharing via community groups, the local press and social media.

At this point, physical delivery of US$4 billion to more than 120,000 communities has to be done on a bimonthly basis. Prospera aims to improve the logistics of these cash transfers through the use of a bank card. However, about 80% of recipients lack access to automated teller machines (ATM) or point-of-sale (POS) terminals to retrieve funds.Although banking infrastructure is largely absent outside major cities, telecommunication infrastructure (in the form of cellular communication) covers more than 70% of the Prospera communities. Most recipients own or have access to a mobile phone. Reaching recipients with communication infrastructure and services seems far more viable than extending banking infrastructure.The aim of Mexico's National Digital Strategy (NDS) is to harness digital solutions to meet the country's development challenges. Prospera Digital, part of NDS, was launched to migrate all Prospera customers to a cashless, electronic payment system based on a mobile banking platform. The benefits of a mobile banking solution are numerous. It potentially reduces the cost of delivery and mitigates security risks for the government as well as for Prospera recipients. The creation of a delivery channel for banking services for the""unbanked,""including savings, remittances, and microcredit is another direct benefit.This project aims to support the design of Prospera Digital by bringing in technical expertise and global good practice. It will support research on technical and policy specifications of the initiative, such as regulatory and operational decisions, user preferences, and incentives for low-cost service delivery. This initiative will also support the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Prospera Digital pilot.

Its goal is to inform and guide the development of innovative public and private sector interventions in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay.Youth unemployment and poverty ongoingA decade of continuous growth and social investment in Latin America has reduced poverty and increased labour market opportunities. However, young people are still waiting to see the benefits of growth. They have higher educational levels, but the employment outlook remains low. Two out of every three young workers are employed in precarious jobs. More than 20 million youth (one in five) are referred to as NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training).Poor groups and women are especially affected. In Mexico, where two in every five youth are NEET, 80% are women. Growth rates in the region have declined since 2011. This may jeopardize the past decade's social gains and increase the challenges that young people face.Employment policies lack effectivenessGovernments have introduced policies to respond to the challenges, but in most cases, they have been not effective in reaching marginalized youth. Public and private sector actors are looking for new approaches to tackle the region's youth employment challenges. This has led to a demand for evidence on effective approaches for specific contexts. To achieve this objective, researchers and policymakers need an in-depth understanding of youth priorities and the solutions they envision to address the problem. What do NEET youth value? What are their motivations and aspirations?Evidence to shape decision-makingThis project will help find answers to these questions to inform appropriate policy responses. The project team will collect data, diagnose the problem, and analyze policy effectiveness to guide the development of innovative public and private sector interventions. The goal is to identify solutions that address NEET youth motivations and aspirations, while generating jobs.Espacio Pu¿blico in Chile will act as the project's coordinating institution.

XM-DAC-301-2-108234-001	00005	15170	This project will identify and analyze economic opportunity policies and practices that aim to support women in Latin America by preventing violence, increasing access to justice, and empowering them economically.Women and inequality in Latin AmericaWomen's economic empowerment and the reduction of violence against women have become urgent priorities in the political and social agendas of Latin American countries. This is particularly true given the deep socio-economic inequalities and the alarmingly high levels of violence that women face. These problems are deeply rooted. They need complex policy approaches and practices.Economic opportunities and violenceGovernments have increasingly introduced special programs and policies to increase women's economic opportunities and to prevent violence against women. Researchers are gathering knowledge on what works and what does not work to address the issues. There is a huge evidence gap regarding the complex relationship between economic empowerment and the reduction of violence against women.Although governments, international aid organizations, and civil society actors believe that economic opportunity programs are effective at reducing violence against women, there is no solid evidence base for this causal link. It is important to understand and analyze whether economic projects, particularly those that claim to prevent violence against women, result in new forms of violence.Solutions to empower women, reduce violenceResearchers will identify and analyze interventions in Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru. They will assess the impact of efforts on:-preventing violence against women-reducing victimization-improving women's access to justiceThe results will guide governments, civil society organizations, and international cooperation agencies as they develop and implement policies and programs.

Homicide rates are among the highest globally. This project will improve capacity to address the problem through research, proposals, and public policies on youth citizen security and youth violence prevention.Violence in Mexico and the Northern TriangleHonduras has a rate of 90.4 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, and El Salvador and Guatemala have 41.2 and 39.9 respectively, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's 2013 report.Young people face deep social inequalities, which puts them at risk of violence and organized crime. The lack of economic opportunities and the extreme high unemployment rates deeply affect young people, particularly youth-at-risk. Young people are both perpetrators and victims. In part, the problem lies in the lack of sound violence reduction strategies targeted at youth.Skills and knowledge to address the violenceThis project will create a platform that will address these challenges by building capacity among civil servants, civil society leaders, and youth organization leaders. It will bring together experts to gather knowledge, promising practices, intervention models, methodologies, and public policies that will strengthen youth citizen security and promote the economic inclusion of at-risk youth in Mexico and Central America.The project team will build a research agenda on public policy influence together with key stakeholders. They will also establish a virtual platform to train actors engaged with youth citizen security and youth violence prevention.

The access to basic services was interrupted and, in some areas, is still weak. The educative infrastructure was seriously damaged in some municipalities, and many children and adolescents have already lost more than a month of classes. The response by the State with prefabricated classrooms will take at least two more months, if funds are provided. The risk of school dropout increases each day, until children are able to resume their regular classes.</p><p>To ensure educational continuity, UNICEF is providing school tents as temporary learning spaces, temporary water and sanitatin facilities, school supplies for students and their teachers, and teacher training in psychosocial support. The first 100 tents have been placed in Morelos and Puebla, and 380 are to be established in Chiapas and Oaxaca.

Oaxaca and Chiapas - 2 of the poorest states in the country - were the most affected with more than 300,000 people (100,000 in Oaxaca and 200,000 Chiapas) and at least 96,000 are children, suffering material losses including damages to more than 110,000 homes (57,000 in Oaxaca and 53,395 in Chiapas). The most severe damage is found in the Istmo of Tehuantepec region in Oaxaca. Immediately after the first earthquake 41 municipalities in Oaxaca and 118 in Chiapas were declared in a state of emergency.

XI-IATI-EC_ECHO-ECHO/-AM/BUD/2018/91015	PROT	72050	<p>In Mexico, Guerrero and Chihuahua are states with very high levels of violence that severely affect the well-being and development of children and adolescents. These contexts of widespread violence resemble the characteristics of a high intensity armed conflict, causing more than 1,000 deaths per year and humanitarian needs due to forced displacement, confinement, restrictions of access to basic services in protection, education and health; and where adolescents have become primary targets for acts of physical, psychological and cultural violence. An estimated 444,000 adolescents aged 12-17 live in Guerrero, from which only 15% feel that they are safe in the streets and 32,000 of girls from aged 15-17 have been victims of sexual violence. Violence due to organized crime in Guerrero caused high numbers of displacement among the local population. On the other hand, around 402,000 adolescents aged 12-17 live in Chihuahua, a state that reported 64 femicides in 2017, of which almost all victims were below the age of 30 and where almost 50,000 girls aged 15-17 have been victims of sexual violence. Given the severe consequences of violence especially on the adolescent population, UNICEF Mexico would like to respond to the protection needs of at least 4,000 adolescent girls and boys by strengthening the capacity of child protection authorities, providing safe spaces in communities and schools and options for alternative care for adolescents. UNICEF Mexico will also work providing alternative means of access to education through innovative means for adolescents who are not able to go to school due to the insecure environment, as well as options for vocational and life skills development. This proposal responds to HIP's priorities in Central America pertaining to rapid expansion of non-political armed groups and organized crime across El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, some of which originate in and also severely affect several states of Mexico.</p>
